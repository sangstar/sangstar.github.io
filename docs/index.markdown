This website serves as a personal online portfolio for me where I mostly ramble about physics, math and ML.


# My personal favorites:

1. [Transformers and ChatGPT](https://sangstar.github.io/nlp/2023/03/03/chatgpt.html)
2. [Performance metrics in NLP](https://sangstar.github.io/nlp/2023/05/15/evaluation_metrics.html)
3. [The misconceptions of the imbalanced dataset](https://sangstar.github.io/ml/2023/04/22/imbalanced-datasets.html)
