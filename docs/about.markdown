I'm a machine learning engineer with a keen interest in natural language processing. I currently work for [Chattr](https://chattr.ai/) based out in Tampa, Fl. 

I graduated from the University of St Andrews with a BA in Physics in 2020. I love learning new things and trying to teach them to others! I'm a big physics nut and authored a piece on adaptive polarimetric gains calibration in 2018 while interning at Harvard. You can read it [here](https://eventhorizontelescope.org/files/eht/files/EHT_memo_Steel_2019-CE-03.pdf) if you're interested! 

In my free time I enjoy walks, playing video games, and pampering my cats.
