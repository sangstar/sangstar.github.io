## Every equation has a derivation
Anyone who took a course on quantum mechanics will tell you that this is not true. Famously, Schr√∂dinger's equation has no formal derivation. Some physicists have tried to "justify" it by playing with the wave equation, but these are all merely attempts to make it make sense. If an equation aids scientists in some way in experiment, it's used and it's good. It doesn't have to make sense.
